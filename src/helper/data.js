            "Visit to the Rozafa Castle in Shkoder treats walkers to exceptional views of the city and the pristine Skutari Lake. A legend says the castle was built by three brothers. Every night the walls of the castle came tumbling down. One day an old man told brothers to mure a woman into the walls, and then they would never collapse and would resist all enemies. The brothers agreed to sacrifice the wife that would bring food for them the next day. Two of the brothers told their women, so the third arrived alone the next day. She therefore was mured, but asked if they could keep out one arm, leg and breast to keep on feeding and hugging her child. Where the tragic legend ends, lovely scenic vistas continue. Shkoder is a nice city to explore. It has been affected by many civilizations trying to conquer it and thus has traces of the Illyrians, Venetians, Ottomans… and the Museum of History will surely keep you occupied for a few hours and give you plentiful information about the city. The legacy of the Communist regime (1944 to 1990) can still be found in Albania, where over 170,000 concrete bunkers in different shapes and sizes were gazing out across the country. Built by the Enver Hoxha regime over the course of 40 years, these bunkers were designed as military defense against invasion by a foreign power. Main attractions are Blloku, the former house of the dictator Enver Hoxha, the Anti-atomic museums Bunker Bunk'art 1 near Dajti Mountain and Bunk'art 2 near the Ministry of Interior in Tirana, The Museum of Secret Surveillance (House of Leaves) of the infamous secret Albanian police Sigurimi, Postbllok monument or Checkpoint in Tirana, the Pyramid in Tirana (a mausoleum built for Enver Hoxha by his daughter and son-in-law), the Bunker of Gjirokaster, Museum of Dictatorship Terror , Diocesan Museum in Shkoder.",
